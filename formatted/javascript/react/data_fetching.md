# Data Fetching

## Caching

- **React Query** - It provides tools for managing, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications.
- **SWR** - It is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching.
- **Suspense** - It allows components to suspend rendering while they fetch data.
- **Fetch API** - A built-in JavaScript API for making HTTP requests.
- **Axios** - A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Promises

- **Promise** - It represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- **Async/Await** - It is a modern way to handle asynchronous functions in JavaScript.
- **Fetch API** - A built-in JavaScript API for making HTTP requests.
- **Axios** - A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Superagent** - A small progressive client-side HTTP request library.
- **Request** - A simplified HTTP request client.
- **Got** - A human-friendly and powerful HTTP request library.
- **Node-fetch** - A light-weight module that brings window.fetch to Node.js.

## URL Parameters

- URL parameters are used to send data to the server during the request. They are added to the end of the URL in key-value pairs. 
- Example: `https://api.example.com/items?category=books&sort=popular`

## Data Fetching Strategies

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** - It renders the React components on the server and sends the HTML to the client.
- **Client-side rendering (CSR)** - It renders the React components on the client side.
- **Static site generation (SSG)** - It generates static HTML files at build time.
